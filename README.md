# CHIRon: A Generative Foundation Model for Structured Sequential Medical Data

This project implements and evaluates a simplified version of the CHIRon architecture â€” a generative model for structured sequential electronic health records (EHRs) using transformers.

The work is inspired by the CHIRon paper presented at the NeurIPS 2023 Generative AI for Science Workshop.

##  Project Goals

- Build a transformer-based generative model for structured sequential patient events.
- Pre-train the model to predict next event tokens autoregressively.
- Evaluate the quality of generated sequences using accuracy and diversity metrics.
- Explore healthcare-specific pretraining using synthetic datasets (e.g., Synthea).
