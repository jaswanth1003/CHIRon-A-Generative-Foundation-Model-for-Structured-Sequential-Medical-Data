# CHIRon: A Generative Foundation Model for Structured Sequential Medical Data

This project implements and evaluates a simplified version of the CHIRon architecture â€” a generative model for structured sequential electronic health records (EHRs) using transformers.

The work is inspired by the CHIRon paper presented at the NeurIPS 2023 Generative AI for Science Workshop.

##  Project Goals

- Build a transformer-based generative model for structured sequential patient events.
- Pre-train the model to predict next event tokens autoregressively.
- Evaluate the quality of generated sequences using accuracy and diversity metrics.
- Explore healthcare-specific pretraining using synthetic datasets (e.g., Synthea).

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chiron-foundation-model.git
cd chiron-foundation-model

### 2. Install Required Packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Prepare the Dataset
Place the Synthea-generated structured datasets (patients.csv, conditions.csv, medications.csv, etc.) into a /data directory inside the project.

Ensure the datasets are cleaned and formatted properly for preprocessing.

### 4. Preprocess the Data
python preprocess_data.py

### 5. Train the Model
python train_model.py

### 6. Generate Sequences
python generate_sequences.py

### 7. Evaluate the Model
python evaluate_model.py
